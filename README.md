# Selected Topics on Signal Processing EEC 372 Assignments
This repository contains all assignments of the Selected Topics on Signal Processing EEC 372 course. In this course, we have covered various topics related to signal processing such as Wiener Filter, Speech Synthesis, LMS, and Steepest Descent.

## Assignments
1. Wiener Filter: In this assignment, we implemented the Wiener filter algorithm to remove noise from a given audio signal.

2. Speech Synthesis: In this assignment, we implemented the speech synthesis algorithm to generate speech from a given text.

3. Steepest Descent: In this assignment, we implemented the Steepest Descent algorithm to minimize the error between a given signal and a desired signal.

4. LMS: In this assignment, we implemented the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm to filter out noise from a given audio signal.

## How to Run the Code
To run the code, you need to have MATLAB installed on your system. Clone this repository to your local machine and open the MATLAB files in MATLAB. You can run the code and observe the results.
